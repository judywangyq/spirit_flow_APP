Iteration 1

Members: Judy Wang, Yingying Feng

App Introduction: 

SpiritFlow provides you with valuable insights, guiding you through life's challenges
through tarot cards reading. Uncover key words and thought-provoking questions that
will help you navigate your day.
In addition, our app goes beyond readings and offers personalized movie
recommendations to boost your luck and inner peace, letting you embrace a journey of
self-discovery and reflection through our journaling feature, allowing you to monitor your
energy flows over time.
